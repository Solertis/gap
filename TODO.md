## TODO

- Add WorldPlugin service that calculates 3d bounding boxes of existing objects
- Add support for spawning light objects from sdf: Gazebo 7 and up has a separate method to spawn lights
- Ensure that a model was spawned by checking its name in the world
- Delete models (and lights) by name
- Cleanup and refactor
